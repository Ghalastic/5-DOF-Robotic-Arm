# 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Robotic Arm
####
## Task Description: 
#### 
Design a 3D robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (DOF).
####
### Introduction:
Designing a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robot arm involves a systematic process that requires understanding mechanical design, kinematics, and electronics.
#### 
### Define the Goal of the Design
####
The goal is to determine what the robot arm will be used for (picking and placing objects, educational purposes, etc.). In this case, it will be used for picking and placing objects.
#### 
### 2. Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Configuration:
####
Decide on the number of joints and their types (rotational or prismatic). 
####
For a 5 DOF arm, typically, it includes:
#### 
- Base rotation
- Shoulder joint
- Elbow joint
- Wrist pitch
- Wrist roll
#### 
### 3. Sketch and Gather Components:
#### 
Sketch: Create a rough sketch of the robot arm on a digital drawing tool.
####
Components: Choose servos, and other actuators that match the design.
####
#### Program:
####
